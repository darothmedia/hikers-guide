Continuing onward, the next few miles contain some elevation gains and losses, with plenty of tree cover for shade and breaks. Enjoy continual peeks at Half Dome and the valley floor along this stretch of trail.

  description: "Hike to two breathtaking waterfalls along some of Yosemite Valley's most popular hiking trails. If you only have time for one hike while in Yosemite look no further - the Mist Trail is the hike for you. It is no wonder why this trail is one of the most traveled in Yosemite National Park. You will hike so close to these two massive waterfalls that you may get wet from the trail. The best time to hike this trail is in Spring or early Summer, while the snow runoff is high and the falls are full of water. The Mist Trail starts at Happy Isles Trailhead (YARTS Happy Isles shuttle stop #16, and within walking distance of Curry Village and the parking lot). The park recommends starting early to avoid the larger crowds. After a brief stroll along the river, you climb a pretty steep initial accent over stone steps until you reach the footbridge, which offers the first glimpse of Vernal Falls in the distance. You will also find a water fountain and restrooms. You will then continue up to Vernal Falls, past Emerald Pool, and alongside Nevada Falls until you reach the high-point of this hike. You can choose to take the alternate route down along the John Muir Trail to see great views of Nevada Falls and Liberty Cap in the distance before meeting back up with the Mist Trail near the footbridge. This route back is slightly longer, but offers a change of scenery and is easier on the knees. Before hopping back on the YARTS shuttle, treat yourself to some ice cream or a refreshing drink at the small stand, or head over to Curry Village for a larger variety of choices.",
